            Eugene Gladstone O'Neill was born in a hotel room on October 16,
            1888 in New York, New York. From an early age, it seemed that Eugene
            would be successful in drama seeing as he was born into theatre.
            This was because his father, James O'Neill, was a well known touring
            actor in the late 19th century thanks to his role in
            <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>. After his birth, his father would
            continue touring this production. Eugene's mother would travel the
            across the country with her husband until the birth of thier sons,
            and eventually Eugene. Mary Ellen, Eugene's mother, had first given
            birth to James Jr. O'Neill. After, Edmund O'Neill was born. However,
            Edmund would die only three years after his birth due to measles.
            Finally, Eugene was born, but his mother was still grieving the
            death of Edmund and would quickly get addicted to morphine. Eugene
            would continue living his life one the road moving from hotel room
            to hotel room. This already rough-and-tumble life was also assisted
            by the strong Irish Catholicism of his father and mystical piety of
            his mother. This struggle would also later show in his plays as the
            struggle between God and religion.

            As Eugene O'Neill newared his 7th birthday, he was sent off to
            boarding school to study at Mt. St. Vincent in the Bronx and Betts
            Academy in Stamford, Conneticut. Here, he also had a strict Catholic
            upbringing adding to the conflict that he had felt earlier. He would
            then return to New York City and attend Princeton University in
            1906. He felt as though studies weren't for him and would soon leave
            Princeton after only 10 months.
